          <h3>
            The American Marketing Association is the essential community for
            marketers.
          </h3>
          <br />
          <p>
            In 1953, Neil Borden transformed the business world when he
            articulated the strategy of “Marketing Mix” in his AMA presidential
            address. Borden was just one of many AMA leaders who were not
            satisfied with existing best practices. These thought leaders sought
            answers for the future that would propel business growth and elevate
            the role of marketing. Today, the AMA leads an unparalleled
            discussion on marketing excellence. Continuing in the tradition of
            Borden and so many others, the AMA offers differentiated content
            that focuses on the tension between Best Versus Next Practices™.
            With content coming from unrivaled scholarly journals, like the
            Journal of Marketing, and award-winning publications, like Marketing
            News, the AMA offers a robust perspective that understands marketers
            are expected to provide both solutions for today and solutions for
            tomorrow. No other organization provides more ways for marketers and
            academics to connect with the people and resources they need to be
            successful.

            <h3>Our Mission for DEI</h3>
            <p>
              The AMA strives to create the essential community for marketers.
              In order to authentically achieve this mission, we are committed
              to making sure that the intersectionality of diverse thought and
              perspectives are reflected, understood, and elevated across our
              community. It is our responsibility to intentionally layer DEI
              best practices into every aspect of our organization, so that this
              work becomes a fundamental part of who we are as a community. For
              us DEI is not a destination, it is a journey and a practice that
              should be a continuous learning process that leads to measurable
              outcomes and impact.
